## *Assignment Tasks*

You are required to complete the following three analysis tasks using Spark Structured APIs. Ensure that your analysis is well-documented, with clear explanations and any relevant visualizations or summaries.

### *1. Identify Departments with High Satisfaction and Engagement*

*Objective:*

Determine which movies have an average watch time greater than 100 minutes and rank them based on user engagement.

*Tasks:*

- *Filter Movies*: Select movies that have been watched for more than 100 minutes on average.
- *Analyze Average Watch Time*: Compute the average watch time per user for each movie.
- *Identify Top Movies*: List movies where the average watch time is among the highest.


*Expected Outcome:*

A list of departments meeting the specified criteria, along with the corresponding percentages.

*Output:*

| Age Group   | Binge Watchers | Percentage |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| senior      | 20             | 58.82      |
| Teen        | 17             | 58.62      |
| Adult       | 19             | 51.35      |

### *2. Identify Churn Risk Users*  

*Objective:*  

Find users who are *at risk of churn* by identifying those with *canceled subscriptions and low watch time (<100 minutes)*.

*Tasks:*  

- *Filter Users*: Select users who have SubscriptionStatus = 'Canceled'.  
- *Analyze Watch Time*: Identify users with WatchTime < 100 minutes.  
- *Count At-Risk Users*: Compute the total number of such users.  

*Expected Outcome:*  

A count of users who *canceled their subscriptions and had low engagement, highlighting **potential churn risks*.

*Output:*  


|Churn Risk Users                                  |	Total Users |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 8                                                |	100         |
